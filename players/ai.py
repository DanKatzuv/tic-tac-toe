        Make a turn.

        The strategy is taken from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy.
        Every turn this method runs on the list of available moves. The player should always pick the first possible
        option. So for example, the player should always try to win (duh ðŸ˜œ), but if this is not possible, and the
        opponent can win in the next turn, player should block, and so on.

        Every option is represented as a method. If an option is possible, its corresponding method will return the row
        and column of the player's choice. If an option is not possible, its corresponding method will not return
        anything (or, in fact, will return None). Only when a positive (None is False) result is returned from a
        certain method, will this method return the player's choice.

        The second player, who shall be designated "O", must respond to X's opening mark in such a way as to avoid
        the forced win. Player O must always respond to a corner opening with a center mark, and to a center opening
        with a corner mark. An edge opening must be answered either with a center mark, a corner mark next to the X,
        or an edge mark opposite the X. Any other responses will allow X to force the win. Once the opening is
        completed, O's task is to follow the above list of priorities in order to force the draw, or else to gain a
        win if X makes a weak play.

        More detailedly, to guarantee a draw, O should adopt the following strategies:
        * If X plays corner opening move, O should take center, and then an edge, forcing X to block in the next
        move. This will stop any forks from happening. When both X and O are perfect players and X chooses to start
        by marking a corner, O takes the center, and X takes the corner opposite the original. In that case,
        O is free to choose any edge as its second move. However, if X is not a perfect player and has played a
        corner and then an edge, O should not play the opposite edge as its second move, because then X is not forced
        to block in the next move and can fork.
        * If X plays edge opening move, O should take center or one of the
        corners adjacent to X, and then follow the above list of priorities, mainly paying attention to block forks.
        * If X plays center opening move, O should take corner, and then follow the above list of priorities,
        mainly paying attention to block forks.
